> Cycle.js is a fully reactive JavaScript framework for Human-Computer Interaction.

Cycle *Core* is the minimum required tools you need for building applications. It is comprised of one single function, `Cycle.run(main, drivers)`.

## Installing

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40cycle%2Fcore.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/%40cycle%2Fcore)

`npm install rx @cycle/core`

Note: `rx` is a **required** dependency. Without it, nothing will change.
